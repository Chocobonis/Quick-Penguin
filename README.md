# Quick-Penguin
an open source of club penguin engine on C++
the idea of this open source club penguin is that anyone can create a 
version/client of the game with a custom client and server using MySQL and C++
please on the use of this engine give credit for the base engine

the credit for this base engine goes to: boniikawaiidesu or boni!soft (me)
pleas DO NOT USE THIS ENGINE WITHOUT PERMISSION OR WITHOUT GIVING CREDIT


to set up the basic server:
 1. open MySQL 
 2. create a user and give a password
 3. create a database and a table
 4. the table must be done with the comand inside the .cpp source
 5. replace the username server password and database inside the .cpp client
 6. compile the .cpp file 
 7. ENJOY!
